# employee-system
For Interface Development task:

This Kotlin project is a management system for a company that handles different types of employees and their roles. The purpose of this system is to manage
employee data such as name, salary, work tasks, and annual bonuses based on the employee's role (e.g., Developer, Manager, Designer). This project implements
abstract classes, derived classes, interfaces, and polymorphism in Kotlin to achieve these goals.
To run this project, you can compile and execute it using any Kotlin compiler or IDE that supports Kotlin. Once the project is compiled, you can run the main
function which creates a list of employee objects and performs various operations such as calling work tasks, displaying details, calculating annual bonuses,
and evaluating performance based on their roles.
This project uses the following technologies:

Kotlin programming language
Abstract classes to define common attributes and methods for all employees.
Derived classes (e.g., Developer, Manager, Designer) that inherit from the abstract class Employee and implement its abstract methods.
Interfaces (e.g., Evaluable) to define additional methods that can be implemented by specific employee types.
Polymorphism to handle objects of different types uniformly through a common interface.
A list of employee objects in the main function to perform operations on multiple employees at once. Overall, this project demonstrates object-oriented
programming concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, interfaces, and polymorphism in Kotlin to create a flexible and scalable management system for handling
different types of employees and their roles.
